    The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo), also known as the panda bear or
    simply the panda, is a bear native to south central China.It is characterised by large, black patches around
    its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from
    the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.

    Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore,
    with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat
    other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive
    honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food

    The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi
    and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of
    the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 report
    showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country.

    As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different
    countries.[14] Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in
    the wild,[13] while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000.[15]
    Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise.[16] In March 2015, conservation
    news site Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864.[17] In
    2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from "endangered" to "vulnerable",[12] affirming decade-long efforts to save
    the panda.

    While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda has often filled this
    role. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example, appearing since 1982
    on gold panda bullion coins and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.
