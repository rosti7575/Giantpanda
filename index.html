    Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore,
    with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat
    other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive
    honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food
